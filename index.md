title: "Scalastyle - Scala style checker"
---

Scalastyle examines your Scala code and indicates potential problems with it. If
you have come across Checkstyle for Java, then you'll have a good idea what
scalastyle is. Except that it's for Scala obviously.

Scalastyle is used as part of the grading framework for the course
[Functional Programming Principles in Scala by Martin Odersky](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun)
on Coursera.

### How do I use scalastyle?

The latest stable version of Scalastyle is {{site.scalastyle-version}} for Scala

There are several ways of using it:

- [SBT plugin](sbt.html)
- [Command line](command-line.html)
- IntelliJ - you can enable scalastyle in IntelliJ by selecting
  Settings->Editor->Inspections, then searching for Scalastyle inspections
- [sonar-scala](https://sonar-scala.com) - Scala plugin for SonarQube with built
  in support for Scalastyle
- [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com) - you get out-of-the-box analysis on your git
  repositories
- [Git pre-commit hook](git-pre-commit-hook.html)

And you'll need a [configuration](configuration.html) file. If you have your own
